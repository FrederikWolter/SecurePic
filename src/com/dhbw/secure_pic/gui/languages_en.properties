lbl.send.desc=Use this if you want to send a message \n\n After you have decided on an encryption method in the next step, you can then encode a message or an image into a so-called container image using selected algorithms. With this method, no difference to the original image is then visible to the naked eye.
lbl.rec.desc=Use this if you want to receive a message \n\n After you choose the corresponding encoding method in the next step. You can then decode the carrier image you received with the algorithm used for encoding. At the end of the process you will see the hidden message.

lbl.no_encryption.desc=Use this if you want no encryption. \n  With this method, your message is encoded without any additional encryption.
lbl.sym_encryption.desc=Use this if you want symmetrical encryption. \n With symmetric encryption, your message is encrypted before encoding using a password you specify. On the receiving end, the same password is then used to decrypt the message.
lbl.asym.encryption.desc=Use this if you want asymmetrical encryption. \n In asymmetric encryption, two keys are first generated on the receiver side. The sender uses the public key to encrypt the message to be encoded. The recipient can then use the private key to decrypt the message.
